1. Method to calculate the area of the square
#creating a tuple
my_tuple = (8,15,25,20,2,60,9)

# converting tuple to a list, sorting a list, and then converting it back to a tuple
sorted_tuple = tuple(sorted(my_tuple))
print(sorted_tuple)



2. Create a tuple of numbers and print sum of all the elements
#creating a tuple
my_tuple = (8,15,25,20,2,60,9)
total_sum =  sum(my_tuple)
print("Sum of all elements in the tuple:", total_sum)



3. Program to find maximum and minimum of tuple.
#creating a tuple
my_tuple = (8,15,25,20,2,60,9)
#finding the max and min value
max_val = max(my_tuple)
min_val = min(my_tuple)
#displaying the maximum and minimum value of tuple
print("Maximum value in the tuple:", max_val)
print("Minimum value in the tuple:", min_val)



4. Count the occurrence of element in tuple in a specific range.
#creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1,2,4,5,2,8,15,25,20,2,60,9,5,2,6,9,3)

start_index = 0
end_index = len(my_tuple)

subtuple = my_tuple[start_index:end_index]
count = subtuple.count(2)

print(f"The element 2 is occurs {count} times in a tuple.")



5. Reverse a tuple.
my_tuple = (8,15,25,20,2,60,9)
reversed_tuple = my_tuple[::-1] 
print("Reversed tuple:",reversed_tuple)
