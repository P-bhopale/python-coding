1. Write a password guessing program to keep track of how many times the user has entered the password wrong. If it is more than 3 times, print "You have been denied access." and terminate the program. If the password is correct, print "You have successfully logged in." and terminate the program. 
correct_password = "pass@123"
count = 0
while count < 3:
    # Input the password from the user
    entered_password = input("Enter the password: ")
    
    # Check if the entered password is correct
    if entered_password == correct_password:
        print("You have successfully logged in.")
        break
    else:
        count += 1
        print(f"Incorrect password. You have {3 - count} attempts left.")
        
# If the user failed to enter the correct password 3 times
if count == 3:
    print("You have been denied access.")


 2. Write a program that asks for two numbers. If the sum of the numbers is greater than 100, print "That is a big number" and terminate the program. 
num1 = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))
sum = num1 + num2

if(sum>100):
    print(f"{sum} is a big number.")
else:
    print(sum)


3. Write a program to check whether the given string is palindrome or not? 
string = input("Enter a string: ")
if string == string[::-1]:
    print("The string is palindrome.")
else:
    print("The string is not a palindrome.")


4. Write a program to Calculate the BMI of a person? 
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilogram: "))
height = float(input("Enter you height in meters: "))
   #calculate BMI
bmi = weight /(height ** 2)
print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi}")    


5.Program to print a Fibonacci Series.
num = int(input("Enter a number of terms: "))
a = 0
b = 1
for m in range(num):
    print(a, end =" ")
    a, b = b, a+b
