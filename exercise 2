1. Python program to calculate simple interest.
   #taking input from user
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest (per annum): "))
time = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))
  #Calculate simple interest
SI = (principal * rate * time)/100
print(f"The simple interest is: {SI}")


2. Python program to calculate compound interest.
P = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
R = float(input("Enter the rate of interest (per annum): "))
T = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))
    #Calculate the amount (Principal + Compound I nterest)
A = P * (1 + R/100) ** T
    #Calculate Compound Interest
CI = A - P
print(f"The Compound Interest is: {CI}")
print(f"The Total amount (Principal + Compound Interest) is: {A}")


3. Python program to check the given year is a leap year or not.
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
    #Check if the year is leap year
if(year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 ) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")



4. Take input from a user that is age and check eligibility for voting or not. 
    #taking age as an input from user
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >=18 :
    print("You are eligible for voting.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible for voting.")


5. Design a simple calculator using if – elif – else statements. 

# Get the numbers and operator from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
operator = input("Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): ")
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform the calculation using if-elif-else statements
if operator == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
elif operator == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
elif operator == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {result}")
elif operator == "/":
    if num2 != 0:  # Check to prevent division by zero
        result = num1 / num2
        print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {result}")
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    print("Invalid operator. Please use one of the following: +, -, *, /.")
